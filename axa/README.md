# Flask example to call webservices in the BE and provide an specific response

This is a simple example of a flask webservice calling a mock and ingesting some of its data

## How to run

If you wish to run flask directly you can do it by setting the environment variable FLASK_APP to "main.py" and then running ```flask run``` in the main directory.

If you have docker installed, you can run it easily with ```docker-compose up```. If not, you can also build the image yourself using the Dockerfile.
